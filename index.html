        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>I was born in Egypt moved to America in 2004 I grew up believing in working hard and always giving everything at least 100 percent of my effort. Currently I attend University of California Riverside where I'm trying to gain my bachelors degree in Biology. I also currently volunteer at Kaiser Permanente Riverside as well as in a majority of CLubs that focus on giving back to my community. Growing up in a very small community we didnâ€™t have the best luxuries and enjoyed all the small things in life. I found a passion for helping others and decided that I want to give back to my community. I participated in community clean ups as well as fundraisers to get clothes, food, and create care packages for the poor. Currently Iâ€™m working on applying for medical school in order to help the the people in need through a medical perspective. Growing up we didnâ€™t have the best access to healthcare which made me sensitive to that plight. Iâ€™m very family oriented as my parents taught me to always help love and support the family. <br>

        I also found myself getting very interested in the aspect of nutrition and sports. After entering my first year in college I found that I gained a lot of weight and that it wasnâ€™t good for my health at all. During highschool I was always active playing basketball and working out but after entering college I found myself lacking the daily exercises that I used to participate in. I therefore decided to begin to workout again as well as exercise in general. I began focusing on my nutrition giving every meal I ate the healthy nutrients it should have and calculating it in order to know exactly what goes into my body. I grew quite fond of nutrition and it taught me a valuable lesson of self-care as well as shattered me into the path of wanting to become  a doctor who emphasizes on preventing diets with specific methodology such as having a healthy diet. <br><br>

        During my delma of gaining weight I also ended up joining a lab at the University of California Riverside that did research on neural energetics that mainly focused on how our body and mind get the energy it needs to function and carryout all of our daily tasks. I learned a lot about the human body and how it is all interconnected and works together in order to maintain homeostasis. I taught the values of teamwork and what it means to be a leader during my experience at this lab and even lead me to get a jab at a Pharmacy in order to understand the mechanisms of medicine and all the variations of medications that our society uses. All these experiences added up and made me medically knowledgeable as well as eager and craving more knowledge of how the human body works which continued my path into the medical field and wanting to help the needy through medicine with all my valuable experiences and life lessons that I was taught.
